    <h2>Who feature for EV scooter  </h2>
    <p>
EV scooters are designed with the latest technology to make traveling smarter and more efficient.
The most important feature is their powerful battery system.
Most scooters use advanced lithium-ion batteries.
These batteries provide a long riding range on a single charge.
Some models can go up to 100–120 kilometers easily.

Charging is simple and convenient for users.
You can charge them at home using a normal socket.
Many models also support fast charging.
With this, the battery can charge up to 80% in just 2–3 hours.
This makes them ideal for busy city lifestyles.

Performance is another highlight of EV scooters.
They can reach speeds of 70–80 km/h.
The ride is smooth, silent, and vibration-free.
This makes the driving experience more comfortable.
Perfect for both short trips and daily commuting.

Safety has been given top priority in EV scooters.
They come with disc brakes and ABS systems.
Bright LED headlights and taillights improve visibility at night.
Some models even feature automatic braking systems.
This ensures maximum protection for riders.

Modern EV scooters are also smart and connected.
They feature digital dashboards showing speed, battery, and distance.
Some offer Bluetooth connectivity and GPS navigation.
With mobile apps, you can track scooter performance.
Features like keyless start and anti-theft alarms add extra convenience.

The design is lightweight yet strong.
Scooters come with ample storage space under the seat.
The stylish body makes them attractive for all age groups.
Most importantly, they are eco-friendly with zero emissions.
This makes EV scooters the perfect mix of technology, comfort, and sustainability.
